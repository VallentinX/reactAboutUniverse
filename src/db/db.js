    question: 'What is an event horizon?',
    answer:
      'An event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. It marks the point of no return. Once something crosses this threshold, it inexorably falls into the black hole due to the extreme gravitational pull. The event horizon is not a physical surface, but rather a mathematical boundary that defines where escape becomes impossible.',

    question: "What happens at a black hole's singularity?",
    answer:
      "At the center of a black hole lies a singularity, a point where density becomes infinite and the laws of physics as we know them break down. It's where all the mass of the black hole is concentrated. Due to this extreme curvature of spacetime, we can’t observe or predict behavior beyond this point, making it one of the most mysterious aspects of black holes.",

    question: 'How do black holes form?',
    answer:
      'Black holes typically form from the remnants of massive stars that undergo supernova explosions. When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse. If the remaining core is massive enough, it compresses into a black hole, while the outer layers are ejected into space, enriching the surrounding environment with heavy elements.',

    id: 4,
    question: 'Can black holes evaporate?',
    answer:
      'Yes, black holes can evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation. Proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking, this phenomenon occurs when virtual particle pairs near the event horizon result in one particle escaping and the other falling into the black hole. Over incredibly long timescales, this radiation causes black holes to lose mass and eventually evaporate completely.',

    question: 'What is a neutron star?',
    answer:
      'A neutron star is the incredibly dense remnant of a supernova explosion, composed almost entirely of neutrons. They are incredibly small, typically about 20 kilometers in diameter but can have a mass greater than that of the Sun. The density is so extreme that a sugar-cube-sized amount of neutron star material would weigh about as much as a mountain on Earth.',

    question: 'What is the speed of light, and why is it significant?',
    answer:
      'The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (about 186,282 miles per second). It is significant because it is the ultimate speed limit in the universe, according to Einstein’s theory of relativity. Nothing can travel faster than light, which shapes our understanding of space, time, and causality.',

    id: 7,
    question: 'How are stars born?',
    answer:
      'Stars are born in nebulae, vast clouds of gas and dust. Under the influence of gravity, these clouds collapse and heat up, leading to nuclear fusion. Once the core temperature reaches about 10 million degrees Celsius, hydrogen atoms fuse into helium, marking the birth of a new star. This process releases immense energy, causing the star to shine.',

    id: 8,
    question: 'What is a supernova?',
    answer:
      "A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion that occurs at the end of a star's life cycle. It happens when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and can no longer withstand gravitational collapse, leading to a catastrophic explosion. Supernovae play a crucial role in enriching the interstellar medium with heavy elements and can briefly outshine entire galaxies.",

    id: 9,
    question: 'What are black holes made of?',
    answer:
      'Black holes themselves are not made of matter in the traditional sense. Instead, they are regions of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing—not even light—can escape. They are defined by their mass, charge, and spin. The matter that formed the black hole becomes compressed into an infinitely dense singularity.',
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: 'Can we see black holes?',
    answer:
      'While black holes themselves are invisible, we can observe their effects on nearby matter. For example, when a black hole pulls in gas and dust from a companion star, the material forms an accretion disk, heating up and emitting X-rays as it spirals inward. We can detect these X-rays and infer the presence of a black hole.',

  {
    id: 11,
    question: 'What is gravitational lensing?',
    answer:
      'Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy or black hole, bends the light from objects behind it due to its gravitational field. This effect can magnify and distort the appearance of distant galaxies, allowing astronomers to study objects that might otherwise be too faint to see. It serves as a powerful tool in cosmology.',
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: 'How do planets form from stars?',
    answer:
      "Planets form from the leftover material of a star's formation process. After a star ignites, the remaining gas and dust in the protoplanetary disk can collide and coalesce into planetesimals, which gradually merge to form planets. This process can take millions of years and results in a diverse array of planetary systems.",

    question: 'What is a white dwarf?',
    answer:
      'A white dwarf is the remnant core of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel. It is very dense, composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, and has a mass similar to the Sun but a volume comparable to Earth. Over billions of years, a white dwarf will cool and fade away, eventually becoming a cold, dark "black dwarf."',

    id: 19,
    question: 'What is the life cycle of a star?',
    answer:
      'The life cycle of a star depends on its mass. Low-mass stars like the Sun will go through stages of hydrogen burning, expansion into red giants, and eventually shed their outer layers to form planetary nebulae, leaving behind white dwarfs. Massive stars undergo more violent endings, often resulting in supernova explosions and leaving behind neutron stars or black holes.',

  {
    id: 22,
    question: 'How does the universe expand?',
    answer:
      'The universe expands as galaxies move away from each other, a phenomenon first observed by Edwin Hubble. This expansion is driven by the initial conditions of the Big Bang. Galaxies are not moving through space but rather the fabric of space itself is stretching, leading to an increase in distance over time. The rate of this expansion is influenced by dark energy.',

    id: 27,
    question: 'What is the role of hydrogen in star formation?',
    answer:
      'Hydrogen is the primary fuel for star formation. In dense regions of molecular clouds, hydrogen gas collapses under its gravity, leading to the birth of new stars. As hydrogen atoms fuse into helium in the star’s core, energy is released, allowing the star to shine and sustain itself over billions of years. Hydrogen’s abundance makes it essential in the cosmos.',
